# Deployment

Our project is not finished yet. But we want to leave a note for future teams.

There are two separate things that need to be deployed:

- The backend server

- The mobile app

Regarding the backend server, you can host it on any clouds/services like Railway, AWS, Heroku, etc.

For the mobile app, you might want to look specifically into how to deploy `Expo` projects. Its flow might be different from bare `React Native` flow.
